# FungicideLossData

We have made available three file formats for the raw data related to soybean losses: xlsx, txt, and csv. The files contain the same column information, including:

Year

State

Total yield loss (1000 metric tons)

Total yield loss (kg/ha)

Total production (1000 metric tons)

Yield (kg/ha)


Foliar fungicide data is available through the USGS website, which is what we used for our research:
